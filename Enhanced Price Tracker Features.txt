Enhanced Price Tracker Features
1. Price Alerts
Purpose: Notify users when a productâ€™s price drops below a user-defined threshold.

Implementation: Add an alert threshold field to the product database, allow users to input it via the GUI, and trigger a popup when the condition is met during scraping.

2. History Viewer
Purpose: Let users view the price history of a tracked product.

Implementation: Add a button in the product table to open a new window displaying the price history stored in the database.

3. Predefined Selectors
Purpose: Simplify adding products from popular websites by auto-filling CSS selectors.

Implementation: Provide a dropdown with predefined selectors for sites like Amazon and eBay, while allowing custom entries.

Versatility
The code uses configurable CSS selectors instead of hardcoding website-specific logic, making it adaptable to any site.
