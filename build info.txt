Key Design Choices
Versatility
Selectors: Uses CSS selectors passed via the GUI, not hardcoded functions.

Scraping: extract_data dynamically handles any selector, ensuring compatibility with various websites.

Database
Products Table: Stores URL, selectors, and alert threshold.

History Table: Logs price, availability, and timestamp for each scrape.

Threading
Scraping runs in a separate thread to keep the GUI responsive, with updates queued to the main thread.

Error Handling
Retries failed requests up to 3 times with a 5-second delay.

Gracefully handles missing data with "N/A" displays.
